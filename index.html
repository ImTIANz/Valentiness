            <textarea id="loveLetter" readonly>
                Before writing this letter, I reflected on our past Valentine's Day celebrations. Unfortunately, most of them were spent apart due to our disagreements. I desire this Valentine's Day to be exceptionally special, and I hope you'll agree to be my Valentine's date forever!

                On this Valentine's Day, I want to express the depth of my feelings for you. Your existence and presence give me a reason to live and fight through every silent battle. In your arms, I feel warmth; in your eyes, I've witnessed the beauty of this universe.
                
                This Valentine's Day, I promise to cherish you more each day. I'll support you and pledge to stand by your side in this sometimes cruel world. Remember, I am not only your best friend but also your lover, so don't hesitate to open up about anything. You know I'll always listen.
                
                I love you so much!
